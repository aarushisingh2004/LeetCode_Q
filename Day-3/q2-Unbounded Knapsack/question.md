# D3Q2: Unbounded Knapsack
## Problem statement

You are given ‘n’ items with certain ‘profit’ and ‘weight’ and a knapsack with weight capacity ‘w’.

You need to fill the knapsack with the items in such a way that you get the maximum profit. You are allowed to take one item multiple times.


Example:
Input: 
'n' = 3, 'w' = 10, 
'profit' = [5, 11, 13]
'weight' = [2, 4, 6]

Output: 27

Explanation:
We can fill the knapsack as:

1 item of weight 6 and 1 item of weight 4.
1 item of weight 6 and 2 items of weight 2.
2 items of weight 4 and 1 item of weight 2.
5 items of weight 2.

The maximum profit will be from case 3 = 11 + 11 + 5 = 27. Therefore maximum profit = 27.


Detailed explanation ( Input/output format, Notes, Images )
Sample Input 1:
3 15
7 2 4
5 10 20

Expected Answer:
21


Output on console:
21


Explanation of Sample Input 1
The given knapsack capacity is 15. We can fill the knapsack as [1, 1, 1] giving us profit 21 and as [1,2] giving us profit 9. Thus maximum profit will be 21.


Sample Input 2
2 3
6 12
4 17


Expected Answer:
0


Output on console:
0


Explanation of Sample Input 2:
We can clearly see that no item has weight less than knapsack capacity. Therefore we can not fill knapsack with any item.


Expected Time Complexity:
Try to solve this in O(n*w).


Constraints
1 <= n <= 10^3
1 <= w <= 10^3
1 <= profit[i] , weight[i] <= 10^8

Time Limit: 1 sec

## P.S Do not make changes here while creating a PR!! The solutions will be released from our end and added here.

How to add a solution:
1. In this particular folder, create a file named "githubUsername--language.md" 
[For example, if "bh-g" is creating a solution in Python, Java and C++ then filename should be "bh-g--JPC.md"]
[Similiarly, creating it for only a particular language for example Java would be: "bh-g--J.md"]
2. We will only consider unique approaches 
3. Even if you wish to submit solution in multiple languages such as Java, C++, Python, etc kindly create a single pull request only.
4. Solutions in the form of images will NOT be accepted.
5. Use "```" aka backticks to create a codeblock in your md files, just add them before and after your code 
The following effect is created by codeblocks and we highly recommend it for the sake of clarity. 

```
printf("Hello, World")
```
